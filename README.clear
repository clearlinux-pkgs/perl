Make sure to re-autospec gitolite whenever perl is upgraded to a new release.
Also bump packages that link to libperl.so, such as those listed by:
dnf repoquery --whatrequires 'libperl.so()(64bit)'
e.g. linux-tools, subversion, openldap

When changing versions of Perl, be sure to update the variable
'inc_version_list' in configure to include the prior version(s) to support.
